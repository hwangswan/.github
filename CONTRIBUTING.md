## 1. Code of Conducts
Please read [the Code of Conduct (CoC)](https://github.com/khongsomeo/blob/master/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) carefully before taking any further actions.

## 2. Contributing
When you are given access to the repository, __fork it__ since we don't allow teams member to have a _write_ permission.

When your tasks is done, create a Pull Request. Your team will do a review, then our staff will do a final review. After that, if it passed every single review then we will merge into master.

_Small tips_: tag the staff so your PR can be reviewed faster.

## 3. Issues
You are free to report any issue / create new issue to suggest new fixture. Just make sure you tag our staff at the end of issue so we can notice it faster.

The issue templates is updating.
