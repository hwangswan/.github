# Report a bug

Shit happens anytime. We can't code a completely perfect software without making any bugs.

Follow these steps below to write a complete report so we can resolve it easily.

## Steps
1. The bug appeared on which project?
2. Some of your information:
  - Which operating system are you using?
  - If you have a bug with a web app project, which browser are you using? That browser's version?
  - If you have a bug with a software project, which release version are you using?
  - If you have a bug while developing one of our projects, what is the commit hash (_commit id_)?
3.Short-describing the bug:
  - When was it happened? (During execution, during installation, during compilation (developing only), etc).
  - Describe the bug, add an image / link to the video if you have.
  - If you have a bug while developing, have you installed any other dependencies?
4. Suggesting a way to resolve. _(This step is only for developer)_

  If you can, create a commit to resolve this bug and create a Pull Request. We'll review it and merge it if that solution is perfect.

## Final
Thank you very much for your patience! We'll resolve this bug as soon as possible.
